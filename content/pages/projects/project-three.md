<div style="text-align: left">```
there is a 
moon sole 
in the blue 
night 
```</div>

```
         amorous of waters 
```

tremulous,
blinded with silence the
undulous heaven yearns where

in tense starlessness
anoint with ardor
the yellow lover

stands in the dumb dark
svelte
and
urgent

```
       (again 
```

love i slowly
gather
of thy languorous mouth the

thrilling
flower)

//

in the rain-
darkness,        the sunset
being sheathed i sit and
think of you

the holy
city which is your face
your little cheeks the streets
of smiles

your eyes half-
thrush
half-angel and your drowsy
lips where float flowers of kiss

and
there is the sweet shy pirouette
your hair
and then

your dancesong
soul.      rarely-beloved
a single star is
uttered,and i

think
of you

```</div>
```
