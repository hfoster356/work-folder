The throes of death are often deeply shamanic - as the spirit hurtles and plummets and is conveyed, the rhythms of movement \[repetitive psychomotor agitation patterns, hypoxic tremor, myoclonic jerks, terminal seizures and convulsions] and breathing \[Cheyne-stokes respirations, Kussmaul and Biot's ataxic respiration patterns, sighing dyspnoea, brainstem agonal reflex breathing, the "Death rattle"] signalling death’s approach adopt ritual context in dance.

The actively dying body takes on a new role as medium between the earthly and supernatural, conducting the soul onward in its raw twitching despair. Jung describes the Shaman as an interlocutor between to the collective unconscious, “whose metier is rooted in the anima relation”, their practice emerging from the divine waters of animal archetypes. The dying body engages with the numinosity of death by the same animal thrashings and gasping of Siberian Shamanic and aboriginal tradition, and of spirit-healers spanning the history of humanity.

In this way the seemingly violent systemic collapse of the body is an ecstatic and psychedelic sublimation.
