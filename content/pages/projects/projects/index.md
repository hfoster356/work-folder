The throes of death are often deeply shamanic - as the spirit hurtles and plummets and is conveyed, the rhythms of movement \[terminal psychomotor agitation, myoclonic jerks, active dying seizures and convulsions, repetitive motion patterns] and breathing \[Cheyne-stokes respiration pattern, Biot's ataxic respirations, sighing dyspnoea, Kussmaul breathing, brainstem agonal reflex breathing, the "Death rattle"] adopt ritual context.

The actively dying body takes on a new role as medium between the earthly and supernatural. Jung describes the Shaman as the interlocutor to the collective unconscious, "whose metier is rooted in the anima relation", acting fundamentally in the archetypal tradition of the animal. The dying body engages with the numinosity of death by the same animal thrashings and gaspings that are employed in dance by Siberian Shamans and spirit-healers across the world. In this way, the systemic collapse of order in the body is an ecstatic and psychedelic sublimation.
